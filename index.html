        Dear Tanisha,
      </p>
      <p class="message">
        I want to sincerely apologize for my actions. I know I have hurt you, and I deeply regret it. Please understand that it was never my intention to cause you pain or disappointment.
      </p>
      <p class="message">
        I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I value our relationship and will do everything in my power to make things right. I understand if it takes time, but I promise I'll learn from this mistake.
      </p>
